# Tests
## Size Test
Check code to see how it functions, currently allows you to create sample databases to test how long it takes to query. 

Since it currently just uses basic math to query, it is quite fast up to the point I tested (1 Million) taking only a split second at that high of a number to find my data based on ID and line number.

Compile test by including the size_test.c file and ../main.h
